# tsx60-value-finder
In this notebook, I evaluate companies trading on the TSX60 in an attempt to find a value investing opportunity.

### About

For this analysis, I evaluate three fundamental components of a publicly-traded stock.

1. Market Cap: The market cap tells the investor about the overall size of a company. Bigger companies tend to have bigger moats which in turn leads to a safer investment.

2. P/E: The price to earnings ratio tells the investor how much there paying for earnings on a per-share basis. Ideally one would want to pay less for more so a lower P/E ratio could indicate value.

3. Dividend Yield: The dividend yield is a key metric for a long term value investor as it allows for a long term strategy with a guaranteed amount of money returning to the investor annually, which can then be reinvested or allocated elsewhere.

In the end, I created a few visualizations to better explain the findings.

***For the total score metric, a lower score is better.
